# arithma

arithma is a simple, mathematics-oriented scripting language.

# Getting started
To install arithma, simply run
```bash
cargo install arithma
```

Then, open up your favorite code editor and create a new file with the suffix `.math`. For help on how to write arithma code, look at the book.

If you'd like syntax highlighting in Visual Studio Code, install the `.vsix` file under `arithma-language-support/`.

For examples, look at the book under `book/` or simply open up the `tests/example.math` file.

Have fun!
