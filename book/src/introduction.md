# Introduction.
arithma is a small [domain-specific language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) for applied mathematics. It allows you to easily compute expressions, define custom functions and algorithms. he language focuses on clarity and mathematical fidelity rather than general-purpose programming constructs.

arithma treats numbers, complex values, vectors, matrices, and sets as first-class citizens. Operators follow mathematical conventions, and functions; whether built-in or user-defined, behave as they do in analytical notation. This allows you to write formulas close to textbook form while remaining executable and type-safe.

A small core syntax supports literal evaluation, function definition, control flow, and iteration. Mathematical functions, constants, and operators are available out of the box, including factorials, exponentiation, trigonometric and logarithmic operations, and vector and complex arithmetic. Control structures, such as `if` and `for`, enable compact algorithmic expression, while blocks and scoped variables avoid naming conflicts.

arithma is a personal perpetually ongoing (research) project exploring how mathematical notation can be expressed and evaluated safely within a computational framework. It serves as a platform for experimenting with language design, numerical semantics, and mathematical expressiveness.
